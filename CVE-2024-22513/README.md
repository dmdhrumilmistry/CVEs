# CVE-2024-22513

The version of [djangorestframework-simplejwt](https://github.com/jazzband/djangorestframework-simplejwt) up to 5.3.1 (latest version) is vulnerable. This vulnerability has the potential to cause various security issues, including Business Object Level Authorization (BOLA), Business Function Level Authorization (BFLA), Information Disclosure, etc. The vulnerability arises from the fact that an user can access web application resources even after their account has been disabled, primarily due to the absence of proper user validation checks.

## Insecure Design

If a programmer generates a JWT token for an inactive user using `AccessToken` class and `for_user` method then a JWT token is returned which can be used for authentication across the django and django rest framework application.

- Start Django shell

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

- Create inactive user and generate token for the user

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import AccessToken

# create inactive user
inactive_user_id = User.objects.create_user('testuser', 'test@example.com', 'testPassw0rd!', is_active=False).id

# django application programmer generates token for the inactive user
AccessToken.for_user(User.objects.get(id=inactive_user_id))  # error should be raised since user is inactive

# django application verifying user token
AccessToken.for_user(User.objects.get(id=inactive_user_id)).verify() # no exception is raised during verification of inactive user token
```

## Impact

Impact would vary from application to application but general impacts are listed below:

- Bypass of Account Deactivation:
    The vulnerability allows an attacker to generate a JWT token for an inactive user. This means that even if an account has been deactivated (e.g., due to suspicious activity or user request), an attacker can still obtain a valid token for that user.

- Authentication Bypass:
    Since the token is successfully generated for the inactive user, an attacker can use this token to authenticate requests to the Django and Django Rest Framework applications. This leads to an authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.

- Authorization Issues:
    Depending on how your application is structured, an attacker with a token for an inactive user might have unintended access to certain functionalities or data. This can result in Business Object Level Authorization (BOLA) issues, where an attacker gains access to resources they shouldn't have.

- Information Disclosure:
    The ability to authenticate as an inactive user could lead to information disclosure. For example, if there are certain resources or endpoints that should only be accessible to active users, an attacker could gain access to sensitive information.

- Security Misconfigurations:
    This vulnerability indicates a potential misconfiguration in the design of the authentication and authorization mechanisms. It could signal a broader issue in the security architecture of the application.

## Detection

SAST Tools can be used to detect this vulnerability in the source code.

Rules:
- [Semgrep Rule](./semgrep.yml)

## Mitigation

As of now, there hasn't been an official release that addresses this vulnerability. If your project utilizes the functionality allowing different subclasses of the `Token` class, it's crucial to take proactive steps to mitigate potential security risks.

Ensure that before generating an access token for a user, there is a thorough verification process to determine whether the user is active or not. This validation step is essential in preventing unauthorized access and helps mitigate the vulnerability associated with the lack of user inactivity validation in the mentioned functionality. Implementing this check adds an extra layer of security to your application.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import AccessToken

user = User.objects.get(id=inactive_user_id)

if user and user.is_active: 
    token = AccessToken.for_user(user)
```

## Additional Information

A few weeks after discovering a vulnerability, I found a new feature in the form of a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jazzband/djangorestframework-simplejwt/pull/776) on the Django Rest Framework SimpleJWT GitHub repository . This feature introduces the ability to use different subclasses of the `Token` class, such as `RefreshToken`, `SlidingToken`, `AccessToken`, and `UntypedToken` with `for_user` method. However, this enhancement also expands the potential attack surface.

Upon further investigation, I noticed that many projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%28%22RefreshToken.for_user%28%22+OR+%22AccessToken.for_user%28%22%29+language%3Apython&type=code&p=2) are utilizing this functionality without implementing proper user inactivity validation. This poses a security risk as it could lead to unauthorized access.

Moreover, it's concerning that the documentation does not provide any security warnings about the potential risks associated with the new feature. This lack of guidance could lead to developers inadvertently exposing their projects to security vulnerabilities.
